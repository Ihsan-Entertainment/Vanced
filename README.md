## About
YouTube Vanced is a modified third-party YouTube application for Android with a built-in adblocker. Other features of the app include SponsorBlock, background play, free picture-in-picture (PiP), an AMOLED black theme, swipe control for brightness and volume, and the ability to restore dislike counts on YouTube videos. A YouTube Music version of Vanced was also developed.

On March 13, 2022, the developers of YouTube Vanced announced that the application would be shut down after they received a cease and desist letter from Google. Google has also forced the developers to stop developing and distributing the app. Although the app will continue to function for users who have already installed it, the app will likely stop working at some point in the future without any further updates. *(Original text: Wikipdia)*<br />
